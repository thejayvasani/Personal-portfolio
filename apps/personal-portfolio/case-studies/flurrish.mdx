            Flurrish is a social media app made for students on campus. Flurrish
            enables students to take part in authentic and personalized
            experiences based on their core interests. Students can browse
            activities, select their interests and then the algorithm will align
            their feed according to their interests. Flurrish focuses on
            expanding the student's network through categored activities and
            events they can partake in. Flurrish enables students to network
            with other students, faculty and employers.

        <h3>Contribution</h3>
        <p>
          Built a PWA Flurrish website with TypeScript, React, Gatsby,
          Contentful and Amplify. Gatsby was leveraged to easily integrate with
          Contentful for sourcing data on build time and rebuilding using
          Amplify on Contentful webhooks. Contentful enabled easier content
          management for the marketing team, reducing the amount of content
          revisions. Having a branded website that displays the products
          Flurrish offers helped sell Flurrish into respectable collages and
          universities around Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assisted on building a React Native app for facilitating student
          engagement by using Expo, React Native and AWS Amplify.
